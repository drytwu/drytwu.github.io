[{"categories":["Prostate cancer"],"contents":"Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer For metastatic prostate cancer, commonly used treatments include hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and novel hormonal agents. However, after using these treatments for a while, prostate cancer may become increasingly uncontrollable.\nPARP Inhibitors For uncontrollable metastatic prostate cancer, PARP inhibitors are the urologist\u0026rsquo;s new weapon!\nPARP inhibitors interfere with cellular DNA repair, causing DNA damage and ultimately leading to cell death.\nIn normal body cells, even when DNA repair is interfered with by PARP inhibitors, there are other backup DNA repair mechanisms that maintain normal cell function. In contrast, research indicates that the backup DNA repair mechanisms in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer cells seem to already be mutated (such as common mutations in the BRCA1/2 tumor suppressor genes). After using PARP inhibitors, further interference with DNA repair in cancer cells ultimately leads to their deaths.\nPhase III Clinical Trials in Western Countries: PARP inhibitors alone (PROfound trial): Metastatic prostate cancer Previously treated with hormonal therapy but now castration-resistant No restriction on whether chemotherapy has been used Previously treated with novel hormonal agents Only patients with mutated DNA repair genes are included. Results: For patients who experienced progression after novel hormonal agents, if genetic testing reveals mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM genes, using PARP inhibitors can extend survival. Combination of PARP inhibitors and novel hormonal agents (ASCO GU 2023 PROpel update): Metastatic prostate cancer Previously treated with hormonal therapy but now castration-resistant No restriction on whether chemotherapy has been used Not previously treated with novel hormonal agents Patients with normal or mutated DNA repair genes are included Results: With combination of PARP inhibitors and novel hormonal agents, the average survival time was nearly four years (42.1 months), the longest among studies of first line treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to date. Common adverse events: Patients may experience side effects such as anemia, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and decreased platelet count after using the drug. It is recommended to have regular blood tests to monitor blood cell counts and liver/kidney function, especially during the initial stages of medication use.\n","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0006_parp-inhibitor/","tags":["Prostate cancer"],"title":"Olaparib: a new medication for metastatic prostate cancer"},{"categories":["Inguinal Hernia"],"contents":"Currently, there are three common types of hernia repair surgeries Traditional Hernia Repair Surgery: Involves a 4 to 5 centimeter incision at the inguinal area, separating the hernia sac, and subsequently stitching and fixing a hernia mesh.\nLaparoscopic Hernia Repair Surgery: Dr. Wu performs a single-incision laparoscopic hernia repair, making a 1.5 centimeter incision below the umbilicus, through which all laparoscopic instruments are inserted and utilized. The entire procedure takes place outside the peritoneum and does not affect the internal organs within the abdomen.\nDa Vinci Robotic Assisted Hernia Repair Surgery: An advanced form of laparoscopic hernia surgery utilizing three small incisions to allow the robotic arms to operate within the body. With 3D laparoscopic imaging and precise manipulation by robotic arms, this approach offers enhanced visibility and meticulous tissue dissection, enabling complex hernia repairs. Similar to the laparoscopic approach, the procedure occurs outside the peritoneum and does not affect the abdominal organs.\nAdvantages of Laparoscopic Surgery 1. Avoiding Missed Diagnoses It enables the simultaneous examination and management of associated femoral or obturator hernias. Clinically, distinguishing between these hernias and inguinal hernias can be challenging. Laparoscopic surgery allows for more precise confirmation of hernia locations and their treatment.\n2. Simultaneous Bilateral Treatment Using a single small incision, both left and right-sided hernias can be treated in one surgery. Conversely, traditional surgery for bilateral hernias results in postoperative pain on both sides. Some patients initially notice a hernia on one side but may later discover a bilateral issue during surgery. Laparoscopic approaches allow for simultaneous management, preventing subsequent hernia occurrences.\n3. Repairing Recurrent Hernias After a previous traditional hernia repair surgery, if a hernia recurs, further surgical intervention may be necessary. Re-operating through the same incision should overcome tissue adhesions and unhealthy tissue condition, making hernia repair challenging. Laparoscopic surgery offers a different approach to repair inguinal hernias, increasing the chances of successful repair.\n4. Substantial Reduction in Pain Traditional surgery incisions are about 4 to 5 centimeters, whereas Dr. Wu\u0026rsquo;s single-incision laparoscopic surgery results in just a 1.5-centimeter incision, significantly reducing postoperative pain. Most patients can resume normal activities the same night as the surgery. Additionally, postoperative chronic pain is also substantially reduced.\n5. Handling Complex Hernias with Da Vinci Robotic System Da Vinci robotic hernia repair surgery, an advanced form of laparoscopic surgery, also accelerates postoperative recovery and reduces chronic pain. With 3D laparoscopic imaging and precise robotic arm manipulation, visibility is enhanced, allowing for more meticulous tissue dissection. In cases of multiple recurrences of inguinal hernias where tissue adhesion complicates surgery, robotic system can help.\nConclusion: The advancements in medical technology, whether in \u0026ldquo;single-incision laparoscopic hernia repair\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Da Vinci robotic assisted hernia repair,\u0026rdquo; significantly reduce patient pain while effectively addressing inguinal hernias.

Inguinal hernias are protrusions of the peritoneum, and the only effective treatment is surgical repair. Medication cannot restore the shape, much like how you can\u0026rsquo;t fix a car dent by changing the oil. More importantly, surgical treatment can prevent complications like the intestines getting stuck in the hernia, leading to incarceration or strangulation. Treating incarcerated or strangulated hernias might require more complex surgery, possibly involving the removal of parts of the intestine.\nHowever, if surgery isn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for a patient, conservative observation might be considered. During conservative observation, attention should be paid to whether the hernia sac is gradually enlarging and whether there\u0026rsquo;s a risk of incarceration or strangulation.\nPatient-Centered Approach Before any treatment, understanding a patient\u0026rsquo;s basic condition and treatment goals is crucial. In fact, this should be the approach for all diseases and their management. Dr. Wu upholds a patient-centered principle, thoroughly discussing options with patients, aiming for the most appropriate solution.\nDuring consultations, Dr. Wu aims to understand the patient\u0026rsquo;s:\nAge: Consideration for conservative observation in older patients Chronic diseases and cardiopulmonary function: Chronic cough? Chronic constipation? peri-anesthesia risks Lifestyle: Extensive stair climbing? Agricultural work? Physical labor requirements? Occupational nature: Sedentary or involving frequent heavy lifting Work environment: Any conditions where hernia belts might not be feasible? Original activity levels Desired treatment outcomes Real-life Cases Here are some actual cases to better understand:\n1. 88-year-old grandmother She had a recurrent inguinal hernia, previously surgically repaired multiple times conventionally. Recently, the hernia recurred causing significant pain, affecting her life. Consulting a general surgeon, due to her old age, conservative observation with pain medication was recommended.\nWhen she visited Dr. Wu, expressing a strong desire for surgery, Dr. Wu initially intended to recommend observation. However, given her surprisingly good cardiac function after thorough pre-operative assessments, Dr. Wu performed a Da Vinci robotic assisted surgery for her recurrent hernia. Post-operation, she was having lunch hours after surgery and experienced minimal pain, successfully discharged the next day.\n2. 67-year-old man He had bilateral inguinal hernias with noticeable symptoms that troubled him for years, and the hernia sac was progressively enlarging. Due to concerns about post-operative pain affecting work, he wished to avoid surgery. Dr. Wu performed a single incision laparoscopic hernia repair for him. After awakening from anesthesia without significant pain, he left the hospital on the same day to resume his work.\n3. 73-year-old man An avid hiker noticed significant pain due to an inguinal hernia recently. He was referred to Dr. Wu by other urologist for surgery. After a detailed consultation, Dr. Wu found that the patient\u0026rsquo;s pain level was moderate, and despite experiencing some discomfort, he could still engage in hiking activities. However, the patient was very anxious and concerned about the surgery. Therefore, although surgery is indeed recommended for this condition, Dr. Wu suggested using a hernia belt at appropriate times and then observing for a period. If the pain persists, surgery is advised. If the symptoms are not bothersome, continued observation is an option.\nConclusion： Surgery is the standard treatment for inguinal hernias, but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to discuss thoroughly with the physician before making a decision.\nNext article, Dr. Wu will discuss \u0026ldquo;Surgical Treatment for Inguinal Hernias.\u0026rdquo; ","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0004_inguinal_hernia_discussion/","tags":["Hernia","Single incision laparoscopic hernia repair","Da Vinci robotic assisted hernia repair"],"title":"Is surgery necessary for inguinal hernias?"},{"categories":["Inguinal Hernia"],"contents":"What is a \u0026ldquo;Hernia\u0026rdquo;? What is a \u0026ldquo;Hernia\u0026rdquo;? Hernia refers to organs being out of their normal position. For instance, when the intestines, which should be inside the abdominal cavity, protrude into the groin area (also known as the inguinal area) or elsewhere. A hernia occurring in the groin area is specifically termed an inguinal hernia.\nWhat are the symptoms of an Inguinal Hernia? Inguinal hernias are actually quite common. Patients may notice varying degrees of protrusion in the groin, some experiencing mild bulging while others have a more prominent bulging. Some individuals might feel noticeable pain or discomfort, while others may not sense anything unusual. These symptoms might develop from being non-existent to bothersome within a week or two. In some cases, the hernia might have been present for an extended period but only noticed accidentally by caregivers or healthcare providers.\nIrrespective of the severity, patients often experience discomfort only when standing, and it might worsen after physical activity. However, upon resting and lying down, as the intestines retract into the abdominal cavity, the protrusion and pain may quickly disappear.\nIs an Inguinal Hernia a Serious Condition? Typically not considered severe. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to monitor for the following symptoms:\nRapid and sustained worsening of groin pain Redness or discoloration in the area of the inguinal hernia Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting If these symptoms occur, it might indicate the progression to an incarcerated hernia or a strangulated hernia, where the intestine becomes stuck in the inguinal hernia. Immediate medical attention is necessary in such cases. Who is at Risk for Inguinal Hernias? Common risk factors include:\nSmoking Chronic lung disease Chronic cough Prolonged heavy lifting Family history of inguinal hernias Having had an inguinal hernia on one side, increasing the likelihood of another hernia on the opposite side. Next article, Dr. Wu will discuss whether \u0026ldquo;Surgical Treatment is Necessary for Inguinal Hernias.\u0026rdquo; ","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0003_inguinal_hernia_introduction/","tags":["Hernia","Single incision laparoscopic hernia repair","Da Vinci robotic assisted hernia repair"],"title":"What is inguinal hernia?"},{"categories":["Da Vinci Surgery"],"contents":"What is en bloc resection of multiple urologic organs？ The en bloc resection of multiple urologic organs refers to the \u0026ldquo;bilateral nephrectomy with bilateral ureterectomy and radical cystectomy.\u0026rdquo; As the name suggests, it\u0026rsquo;s a procedure where both sides of the kidneys, both ureters, and the bladder are removed, considered the most extensive surgery in urology.\nWhat kind of patients need to undergo such extensive surgery? In Taiwan, there is a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and patients undergoing dialysis, who are at a higher risk of developing multiple urinary tract epithelial tumors compared to the general population. Prolonged dialysis in patients not only results in the loss of urinary organ function but also carries the risk of potential malignancy. Therefore, patients who need to undergo this surgery generally fall into two categories:\nPatients concurrently suffering from bladder tumors and tumors in both kidneys or ureters, which cannot be treated by organ-preserving methods. While long-term dialysis patients are diagnosed with bladder, kidney, or ureter tumors, imaging studies (such as CT scans or MRI) might reveal other suspicious lesions that could also be tumors. After discussions between the physician and the patient, the decision is made to surgically remove all urinary organs to prevent malignancy in the future. Perioperative risks? Given the extensiveness of this surgery, traditionally, it requires opening the entire abdomen to complete the surgery. While dialysis patients often experience weakened physical condition, compromised immunity, and poor cardiovascular function due to long-term dialysis, making them more susceptible to postoperative complications such as infections, unstable blood circulation, intestinal obstruction, electrolyte imbalances, and pulmonary edema.\nThe role of Da Vinci robotic surgery system? With the assistance of the Da Vinci robotic surgery system, this surgery can be performed through several small incisions and one four to five centimeters incision (for specimen removal). This method allows for more delicate tissue dissection, reducing intraoperative bleeding, and expediting the patient\u0026rsquo;s postoperative recovery.\nConclusion: En bloc resection of multiple urologic organs is a major surgery that requires detailed discussion with the physician beforehand. The Da Vinci robotic surgery system can expedite the patient\u0026rsquo;s postoperative recovery.

Any other treatable disease been ruled out? Common conditions include: Urinary tract infections, stones, or tumors Atrophic vaginitis in menopausal women Pelvic organ prolapse Polyuria associated with diabetes 3. Attempt to increase the dosage of the medication without increasing side effects Typically, medications commonly used for overactive bladder syndrome are extended-release tablets taken once daily, including 4mg of Detrusitol and 5mg of Vesicare. Additionally, according to the reference, Oxybutynin 5mg can be increased based on clinical needs up to six tablets per day; Propiverine 15mg can be increased based on clinical needs up to four tablets per day. Mirabegron can be adjusted clinically to either 25mg or 50mg dosage. In clinical practice, if a single drug response is poor, the common approach is to combine Mirabegron with other medications.\nSome literature in western countries suggests that attempting to increase the dosage of commonly used medications can achieve better therapeutic effects, and even if the recommended dosage in the reference is exceeded, it is still safe to use. These include:\nIncreasing Vesicare dosage up to 10mg daily. Increasing Detrusitol dosage up to 16mg daily. These studies also found that using previously less commonly combined medications can yield better therapeutic effects while still being safe. These combinations include:\nCombining Detrusitol 4mg with Oxybutynin 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Combining Detrusitol 4mg with Vesicare 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Combining Oxybutynin 5mg with Vesicare 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Conclusion: Each patient\u0026rsquo;s condition is unique. It is recommended to have a detailed discussion with a physician and jointly decide on the best treatment approach for oneself.
