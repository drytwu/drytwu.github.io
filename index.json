[{"categories":["Prostate cancer"],"contents":"Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer For metastatic prostate cancer, commonly used treatments include hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and novel hormonal agents. However, after using these treatments for a while, prostate cancer may become increasingly uncontrollable.\nPARP Inhibitors For uncontrollable metastatic prostate cancer, PARP inhibitors are the urologist\u0026rsquo;s new weapon!\nPARP inhibitors interfere with cellular DNA repair, causing DNA damage and ultimately leading to cell death.\nIn normal body cells, even when DNA repair is interfered with by PARP inhibitors, there are other backup DNA repair mechanisms that maintain normal cell function. In contrast, research indicates that the backup DNA repair mechanisms in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer cells seem to already be mutated (such as common mutations in the BRCA1/2 tumor suppressor genes). After using PARP inhibitors, further interference with DNA repair in cancer cells ultimately leads to their deaths.\nPhase III Clinical Trials in Western Countries: PARP inhibitors alone (PROfound trial): Metastatic prostate cancer Previously treated with hormonal therapy but now castration-resistant No restriction on whether chemotherapy has been used Previously treated with novel hormonal agents Only patients with mutated DNA repair genes are included. Results: For patients who experienced progression after novel hormonal agents, if genetic testing reveals mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM genes, using PARP inhibitors can extend survival. Combination of PARP inhibitors and novel hormonal agents (ASCO GU 2023 PROpel update): Metastatic prostate cancer Previously treated with hormonal therapy but now castration-resistant No restriction on whether chemotherapy has been used Not previously treated with novel hormonal agents Patients with normal or mutated DNA repair genes are included Results: With combination of PARP inhibitors and novel hormonal agents, the average survival time was nearly four years (42.1 months), the longest among studies of first line treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to date. Common adverse events: Patients may experience side effects such as anemia, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and decreased platelet count after using the drug. It is recommended to have regular blood tests to monitor blood cell counts and liver/kidney function, especially during the initial stages of medication use.\n","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0006_parp-inhibitor/","tags":["Prostate cancer"],"title":"Olaparib: a new medication for metastatic prostate cancer"},{"categories":["Inguinal Hernia"],"contents":"目前醫學上常見的疝氣修補手術有三種 傳統疝氣修補手術：在腹股溝處劃開4到5公分的傷口，將疝氣囊剝離，再將人工網膜縫合固定\n腹腔鏡疝氣修補手術：吳醫師施行的是單孔腹腔鏡疝氣手術，在肚臍下方劃開1.5公分的傷口，所有腹腔鏡器械將從這個傷口進出。整個過程均在腹膜之外進行，不會影響腹腔內器官。\n達文西機器手臂疝氣修補手術：更進階的腹腔鏡疝氣手術，經由三個小傷口讓機械手臂在人體內運作。透過3D的腹腔鏡影像搭配機械手臂的精密操作，看得更清楚、讓組織剝離更加細緻，能進行複雜的疝氣修補。整個過程亦在腹膜之外進行，不會影響腹腔內器官。\n腹腔鏡手術的優點 1.避免遺漏 同時檢查是否合併股疝氣或是閉孔疝氣。這兩種疝氣與腹股溝疝氣在臨床上並不容易區別。然而，傳統手術要在術中診斷並同時處理這兩種疝氣較為困難。腹腔鏡手術可較詳細地確認疝氣位置並加以處理。\n2.可同時處理雙側 同一個傷口，可以在同一次手術，同時處理左右兩側的疝氣。相反地，若需傳統手術處理雙側疝氣，雙側腹股溝都得承受術後的疼痛。部分患者原本只發現單側患有腹股溝疝氣，卻在術中發現對側其實也有，此時一併處理可免掉下一次疝氣發作之苦。\n3.修補復發型疝氣 患者的腹股溝疝氣在前次的傳統疝氣修補手術後，如果疝氣復發了可能需要再一次手術治療。假如從同樣的傷口進行手術，組織容易沾黏、不健康，疝氣的修補也就變得困雃。腹腔鏡手術可以從另一個角度將腹股溝疝氣好好處理，增加成功的機會。\n4.大幅減少疼痛 傳統手術傷口約4到5公分，而吳醫師施行的單孔腹腔鏡手術只有一個約1.5公分的傷口，大幅減少術後疼痛，大部分患者在手術當晚就能正常活動。此外，術後的慢性疼痛也是大幅減少。\n5.達文西機器手臂處理複雜疝氣 達文西機器手臂疝氣修補手術算是進階的腹腔鏡手術，同樣能夠加速術後復原、減少術後慢性疼痛。透過3D的腹腔鏡影像搭配機械手臂的精密操作，看得更清楚、組織剝離更加細緻。此外，若患者腹股溝疝氣多次復發，組織沾黏手術困難，就可能需要機械手臂輔助完成手術。\n結語：醫療科技進步，無論是「單孔腹腔鏡疝氣手術」或是「達文西機器手臂疝氣手術」均能大幅減少患者的疼痛，同時有效地處理腹股溝疝氣。 ","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0005_inguinal_hernia_surgery/","tags":["疝氣","單孔腹腔鏡疝氣修補","達文西疝氣修補"],"title":"腹股溝疝氣的手術治療"},{"categories":["Inguinal Hernia"],"contents":"疝氣應該怎麼治療？ 腹股溝疝氣是腹膜的突出變形，唯一有效的治療方式為外科手術修補，無法藉由藥物治療恢復形狀。這就像汽車鈑金凹陷一樣，沒有辦法藉由更換機油修復。更重要的是，手術治療能預防腸內器官膨出後發生沾黏而無法推回腹腔，演變成嵌頓性疝氣或是絞勒性疝氣。嵌頓性疝氣或是絞勒性疝氣需要較複雜的手術才能處理，甚至可能需要切除部分腸道。\n然而，如果患者不適合接受手術時，可考慮保守觀察。保守觀察時，需注意疝氣囊是否逐漸變大，也需注意是否併發嵌頓性疝氣或是絞勒性疝氣。\n以病患為中心 在進行任何治療前，需要先了解每位病患的基本狀況以及希望達到的治療目標。其實疾病的治療與處置皆應當如此，吳醫師會秉持「以病患為中心」的原則與患者詳細討論，以期能以最適當的方式替患者解決問題。\n在問診的過程中，吳醫師會試著了解患者的\n年齡：如果年事已高，可考慮保守觀察 慢性病與心肺功能：是否長期咳嗽或長期便秘、評估麻醉前後的風險 生活模式：是否需要走大量樓梯、是否需要農作或勞動等等 工作性質：靜坐性質居多或需頻繁搬運重物 工作環境：是否悶熱而不太可能使用疝氣帶 原本的活動能力 希望達到的治療目標 實際案例 以下是一些實際案例，大家看了可以更了解：\n1. 88歲婆婆 單側腹股溝疝氣在數年前曾經接受傳統刀口疝氣修補手術，近幾個月以來又再次復發，明顯疼痛且困擾生活。曾經求診於一般外科，然而因為高齡，一般外科醫師建議觀察合併止痛藥物控制。婆婆和女兒們來到吳醫師診間時，表達強烈希望手術的意願，而且希望用最好的。\n其實考量到年事已高，吳醫師原本也是打算建議婆婆觀察就好，出於婆婆強烈堅持，吳醫師先安排了相關術前檢查，結果顯示心臟功能非常好，可承擔麻醉手術風險。於是，吳醫師替這位婆婆施行達文西機械手臂復發性疝氣修補手術，仔細處理復發的疝氣。術後幾小時吳醫師查房，婆婆已經在吃便當了，幾無疼痛，隔日順利出院。\n2. 67歲先生 雙側腹股溝疝氣合併明顯症狀，困擾這位患者已數年，疝氣囊越來越大。然而事業忙碌，這位患者因爲害怕術後疼痛導致工作受到影響而一直希望避免開刀。因此，吳醫師替這位患者施行單孔腹腔鏡疝氣修補手術。患者在麻醉後清醒過來，發現無明顯傷口疼痛後，手術當天就出院繼續打拼事業了。\n3. 73歲先生 喜歡爬山，最近幾週發現自己腹股溝疝氣合併明顯疼痛，經同行轉介到吳醫師門診安排手術。吳醫師詳細問診後發現，患者的疼痛程度一般，即使稍有疼痛但仍然可以進行爬山運動。但是患者對於手術相當擔心緊張。因此，雖然這樣的病況的確建議手術治療，但是吳醫師建議可搭配適時的疝氣帶使用，然後再觀察一段時間，如果疼痛真的持續發生，還是建議手術治療。\n結語： 外科手術為腹股溝疝氣的標準治療方式，建議與醫師詳細討論後，與醫師一起做決定。\n下一篇，吳醫師將與您討論，「腹股溝疝氣的手術治療」 ","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0004_inguinal_hernia_discussion/","tags":["疝氣","單孔腹腔鏡疝氣修補","達文西疝氣修補"],"title":"腹股溝疝氣是否需要手術治療呢？"},{"categories":["Inguinal Hernia"],"contents":"What is a \u0026ldquo;Hernia\u0026rdquo;? What is a \u0026ldquo;Hernia\u0026rdquo;? Hernia refers to organs being out of their normal position. For instance, when the intestines, which should be inside the abdominal cavity, protrude into the groin area (also known as the inguinal area) or elsewhere. A hernia occurring in the groin area is specifically termed an inguinal hernia.\nWhat are the symptoms of an Inguinal Hernia? Inguinal hernias are actually quite common. Patients may notice varying degrees of protrusion in the groin, some experiencing mild bulging while others have a more prominent bulging. Some individuals might feel noticeable pain or discomfort, while others may not sense anything unusual. These symptoms might develop from being non-existent to bothersome within a week or two. In some cases, the hernia might have been present for an extended period but only noticed accidentally by caregivers or healthcare providers.\nIrrespective of the severity, patients often experience discomfort only when standing, and it might worsen after physical activity. However, upon resting and lying down, as the intestines retract into the abdominal cavity, the protrusion and pain may quickly disappear.\nIs an Inguinal Hernia a Serious Condition? Typically not considered severe. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to monitor for the following symptoms:\nRapid and sustained worsening of groin pain Redness or discoloration in the area of the inguinal hernia Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting If these symptoms occur, it might indicate the progression to an incarcerated hernia or a strangulated hernia, where the intestine becomes stuck in the inguinal hernia. Immediate medical attention is necessary in such cases. Who is at Risk for Inguinal Hernias? Common risk factors include:\nSmoking Chronic lung disease Chronic cough Prolonged heavy lifting Family history of inguinal hernias Having had an inguinal hernia on one side, increasing the likelihood of another hernia on the opposite side. Next article, Dr. Wu will discuss whether \u0026ldquo;Surgical Treatment is Necessary for Inguinal Hernias.\u0026rdquo; ","permalink":"https://drytwu.github.io/blog/0003_inguinal_hernia_introduction/","tags":["Hernia","Single incision laparoscopic hernia repair","Da Vinci robotic assisted hernia repair"],"title":"What is inguinal hernia?"},{"categories":["Da Vinci Surgery"],"contents":"What is en bloc resection of multiple urologic organs？ The en bloc resection of multiple urologic organs refers to the \u0026ldquo;bilateral nephrectomy with bilateral ureterectomy and radical cystectomy.\u0026rdquo; As the name suggests, it\u0026rsquo;s a procedure where both sides of the kidneys, both ureters, and the bladder are removed, considered the most extensive surgery in urology.\nWhat kind of patients need to undergo such extensive surgery? In Taiwan, there is a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and patients undergoing dialysis, who are at a higher risk of developing multiple urinary tract epithelial tumors compared to the general population. Prolonged dialysis in patients not only results in the loss of urinary organ function but also carries the risk of potential malignancy. Therefore, patients who need to undergo this surgery generally fall into two categories:\nPatients concurrently suffering from bladder tumors and tumors in both kidneys or ureters, which cannot be treated by organ-preserving methods. While long-term dialysis patients are diagnosed with bladder, kidney, or ureter tumors, imaging studies (such as CT scans or MRI) might reveal other suspicious lesions that could also be tumors. After discussions between the physician and the patient, the decision is made to surgically remove all urinary organs to prevent malignancy in the future. Perioperative risks? Given the extensiveness of this surgery, traditionally, it requires opening the entire abdomen to complete the surgery. While dialysis patients often experience weakened physical condition, compromised immunity, and poor cardiovascular function due to long-term dialysis, making them more susceptible to postoperative complications such as infections, unstable blood circulation, intestinal obstruction, electrolyte imbalances, and pulmonary edema.\nThe role of Da Vinci robotic surgery system? With the assistance of the Da Vinci robotic surgery system, this surgery can be performed through several small incisions and one four to five centimeters incision (for specimen removal). This method allows for more delicate tissue dissection, reducing intraoperative bleeding, and expediting the patient\u0026rsquo;s postoperative recovery.\nConclusion: En bloc resection of multiple urologic organs is a major surgery that requires detailed discussion with the physician beforehand. The Da Vinci robotic surgery system can expedite the patient\u0026rsquo;s postoperative recovery.

Adequate behavior therapy? Have you tried adjusting your lifestyle and habits? Do you understand how to perform bladder training and pelvic floor muscle exercises? 2. Any other treatable disease been ruled out? Common conditions include: Urinary tract infections, stones, or tumors Atrophic vaginitis in menopausal women Pelvic organ prolapse Polyuria associated with diabetes 3. Attempt to increase the dosage of the medication without increasing side effects Typically, medications commonly used for overactive bladder syndrome are extended-release tablets taken once daily, including 4mg of Detrusitol and 5mg of Vesicare. Additionally, according to the reference, Oxybutynin 5mg can be increased based on clinical needs up to six tablets per day; Propiverine 15mg can be increased based on clinical needs up to four tablets per day. Mirabegron can be adjusted clinically to either 25mg or 50mg dosage. In clinical practice, if a single drug response is poor, the common approach is to combine Mirabegron with other medications.\nSome literature in western countries suggests that attempting to increase the dosage of commonly used medications can achieve better therapeutic effects, and even if the recommended dosage in the reference is exceeded, it is still safe to use. These include:\nIncreasing Vesicare dosage up to 10mg daily. Increasing Detrusitol dosage up to 16mg daily. These studies also found that using previously less commonly combined medications can yield better therapeutic effects while still being safe. These combinations include:\nCombining Detrusitol 4mg with Oxybutynin 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Combining Detrusitol 4mg with Vesicare 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Combining Oxybutynin 5mg with Vesicare 5mg, then adjusting the dosage based on clinical needs. Conclusion: Each patient\u0026rsquo;s condition is unique. It is recommended to have a detailed discussion with a physician and jointly decide on the best treatment approach for oneself.
